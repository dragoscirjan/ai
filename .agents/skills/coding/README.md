# Coding

`coding` is the generic base skill for code changes in any language. It combines project-first design, contextual engineering principles, risk-based security, behavior-focused testing, and explicit quality-gate reporting.

The skill avoids clean-code dogma. KISS, YAGNI, DRY, SOLID, design patterns, and functional techniques are useful only when they make the current code easier to understand, change, test, or secure.

## Sources

The security guidance uses these references:

- [OWASP Developer Guide](https://devguide.owasp.org/)
- [OWASP Developer Guide secure coding checklist](https://devguide.owasp.org/en/04-design/02-web-app-checklist/)
- [CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/)

The [OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/) is archived. OWASP migrated and updated its checklist content in the Developer Guide, so the skill uses the current Developer Guide sources above.

The duplicate-code fallback is [jscpd](https://jscpd.dev/), which supports more than 200 languages. Existing project tooling still takes precedence.

These sources guide risk analysis. They are not copied into the skill and do not replace project-specific requirements.

## Independent guidance and composition

`coding` is an independent base skill. [`coding-with-rules`](../coding-with-rules/SKILL.md) is the language-aware entry point and declares `require: ["coding"]`. Both remain discoverable siblings under `.agents/skills/`, with exact relative Claude projections under `.claude/skills/`.

This repository's `AGENTS.md` selects the composition for code work. Project routing resolves `coding` first, then the composition selects task-relevant language and extension documents from its `references/` directory. Those documents are supporting files, not separate skills. Shared-code dependencies remain distinct from instruction requirements. No native harness dependency loader is assumed.

## Quality gates

The generic skill defines gate categories and reporting. Language references select project-first fallback tools for those categories.

Every language reference must account for:

- formatting
- compilation or type checking when applicable
- linting or static analysis
- focused and broader tests
- jscpd as the fallback duplicate detector
- security analysis
- dependency or package auditing

A language reference may mark a category unsupported when its ecosystem has no mature option. It must explain that result and must not claim the gate passed.

Numeric thresholds come from project configuration. The skill family does not define universal coverage, duplication, or complexity numbers.

## Invocation

Pi exposes the skill through its [`/skill:name` command](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/skills):

```text
/skill:coding Implement the approved change and run the applicable project gates.
```

OpenCode exposes this skill as `/coding` because its frontmatter sets `metadata.opencode/slash` to `"true"`; see the [OpenCode skill documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills):

```text
/coding Implement the approved change and run the applicable project gates.
```

For language-specific work, select `coding-with-rules` and its declared `coding` requirement. See its [usage and migration guide](../coding-with-rules/README.md).

## Files

- [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) contains the coding workflow.
- `README.md` explains the design, sources, and composition contract.

Keep the directory name and the `name` field in `SKILL.md` set to `coding` for portable Agent Skills discovery.

See [issue 14](https://github.com/dragoscirjan/ai/issues/14) for the family architecture and [issue 15](https://github.com/dragoscirjan/ai/issues/15) for this implementation phase.
